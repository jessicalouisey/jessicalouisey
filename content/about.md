I live in the liminal spaces. i am a walking dichotomy. i stay in the in-between, floating in the crevices of my own brain. this is where i aim to think out loud. where i can unravel the knots, chase the ideas, sit in the contradictions. no clear answers, just explorations. no single path, just movement. join me on my journey.
