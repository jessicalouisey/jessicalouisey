If I just wrote one sentence a day, one word, would it change me as a person? Perhaps not. But if it became a consistent habit then one can only hope to get better at it. As someone who journals daily, every evening -- between the hours of 6pm and 10pm, give or take, and mostly writing about nothing in particular, until one day, the God's have found the channel between them and my hand, my pen, and I write pages upon pages of words that sometimes I don't even recognise when I read them back. If I ever read them back. That's the best thing about journalling, really. Get it out of my head and onto the page, then close the notebook firmly shut and never think about it again. Out of sight, out of mind. 

But sometimes, the thoughts will still linger. Sometimes an idea feels to big, too tangible to keep inside of closed books. And I suppose that's what inspired me to have a more open source for journalling, to write the very same way I do in my journals (although perhaps a bit more proofread), but in the hopes that maybe one day, someone out outside of myself may stumble across this tiny corner of the internet and find something.
