      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone who lives mostly inside their head and has a tendency to spiral, existentialism and a touch of absurdism are generally things that keep me going in life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been watching &lt;em&gt;The Gift&lt;/em&gt;, a Turkish series focusing on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1572/&#34;&gt;GÃ¶bekli Tepe&lt;/a&gt;. There was a quote that has been stuck with me ever since:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as time. Everything in the universe happens at once. We only perceive things sequentially because that&amp;rsquo;s what we were taught. Yet, every choice we make leads to a new possiblity. We effect everything in a timeless place, even if we don&amp;rsquo;t realise it. (S3 E2)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I just wrote one sentence a day, one word, would it change me as a person? Perhaps not. But if it became a consistent habit then one can only hope to get better at it. As someone who journals daily, every evening &amp;ndash; between the hours of 6pm and 10pm, give or take, and mostly writing about nothing in particular, until one day, the God&amp;rsquo;s have found the channel between them and my hand, my pen, and I write pages upon pages of words that sometimes I don&amp;rsquo;t even recognise when I read them back. If I ever read them back. That&amp;rsquo;s the best thing about journalling, really. Get it out of my head and onto the page, then close the notebook firmly shut and never think about it again. Out of sight, out of mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I live in the liminal spaces. i am a walking dichotomy. i stay in the in-between, floating in the crevices of my own brain. this is where i aim to think out loud. where i can unravel the knots, chase the ideas, sit in the contradictions. no clear answers, just explorations. no single path, just movement. join me on my journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
